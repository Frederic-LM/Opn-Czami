#  **LegatoKey: Modern & Tamper-Proof Certification**

**LegatoKey** is a modern system designed to help you issue **tamper-proof, cryptographically signed digital documents** without abandoning the physical format.
It isn't a corporate product—it was crafted by a luthier with a computer science background whose every design choice reflects real-world instrument appraisal needs.

## 🌿 The Legato Ecosystem is composed of:
- **📱 The LegatoLink App**: A free, client-side verification app.
- **🧾 Op'n Czami**: An open-source authority dashboard to generate and sign certificates.

## Why Use LegatoKey?

Traditional paper certificates or valuations can be lost, damaged, forged, or even digitally manipulated.
In the world of fine instruments, where trust and provenance are fundamental, that's a real risk and liability. 

LegatoKey solves this by issuing **linked physical + digital certificates**:

- ✅ A physical certificate to hold.
- ✅ Tamper-proof digital certificates anyone can verify online.
- ✅ Proof your signature hasn't been altered or faked.

### 🔐 How It Works

Legato Key binds physical and digital worlds with cryptographic signatures:

✅ **Tamper-proof digital certificates**  
🔗 **Cryptographically Bound** — Ties the printed document and its digital counterpart.  
🌍 **Verifiable by Anyone** — Online, instantly, without needing to contact you.  
🖼️ **Image + Text Protected** — Covers visual and written content alike.  
🔓 **No Vendor Lock-in** — You stay independent, with no forced subscriptions.
